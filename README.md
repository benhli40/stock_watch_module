# stock_watch_module
A stock watch module in Python using alpha_vantage API

As I've been using Python lately for a lot of different code ideas,
including a recent weather_module I made, this is just another part 
of a larger project that will let businessmen, Wall Street 
professionals, entrepreneurs know what's going on in the market.

This actually only gives what the current stock price is, not really
what's going on over the course of the day. So, keep that in mind.
I was simply trying my hand at something to make it work.
